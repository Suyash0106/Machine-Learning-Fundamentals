# Machine-Learning-Fundamentals
The objective of this project is to develop an acumen of model complexity, model selection, uncertainty in prediction with bootstrapping, probabilistic machine learning, and linear models for regression and classification.

Please refer to the "Task Description" file for a detailed explaination of each task. The tasks are divided into 7 sections ranging A to G and the solution of tasks in each section is organised in a dedicated folder. To make it more intuitive, each folder is named same as the name of each section in the description file.
